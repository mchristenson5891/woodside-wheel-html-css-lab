# HTML / CSS Lab

In this lab you will practice converting a design into HTML and CSS

The design is included in `design.png`.

Convert the design into HTML in the `index.html` file, and then write the CSS in `main.css`.

We'll provide some style information below. You can approximate spacing.

Content for the page can be found in copy.txt.

Links do not need to go anywhere.

## Provided style information

#### I have already set these styles on 'body' to get the page started:
  High-level text properties
  "Lato" font
  1.5 line-height

  The main content (I have already set on 'body' to get the page started):
  max-width 720px
  54px of padding
  border should be solid on the left and 6px wide with a color of #e2231a

#### YOU DO:

  Links (and other red colored text)
  Text color #e2231a

  Headings:
  font-weight: 100

  Date:
  Text color #cccccc

  Article Title
  Text color black

  HINT: you can make the images fit nicely inside their parent elements by setting `width: 100%`

  HINT 2: to right align "continues" it may be easiest for now to make that element a heading and use `text-align: right`

  Bonus: look up how to do element hover styles;
  Links hover:
  Text color #aa0000
